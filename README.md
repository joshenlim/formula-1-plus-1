## What is this

It's like TypeRacer, but with Math instead. Play either solo, or with some friends! Multiplayer allows you to play one of two game modes: Time Based or Fastest First

- Time Based: Answer as many questions as possible within 30 seconds, the one that submits the correct answer first "steals" that question, and the next question is prompted for all players

- Fastest First: Answer 30 questions as quickly as possible, the one who completes all 30 questions first wins the game

Games can be configured based on the number of digits (1, 10, 100) and what operators to use (+, -, ×, ÷). I've only ever tried 1 digit and only addition while testing though (I struggle with anything more 😂). Past game data are all stored to your profile so you can see what your Math performance is like 😉

## Why build this

This project is a contribution to Supabase's [dog-fooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) efforts, by using our own technologies from the POV as a developer ourselves. The main outcome wasn't to have a finished product though, but rather to detail a friction log while building the app, so that we can thereafter close those gaps that were identified.

Which also means that this app is by no means _optimized_ or should be used as a best practice reference at all 😬 I just got it to a state of it working properly.
